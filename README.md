One click AI solution accelerators powered by Azure AI services

Working with partners, we come across demand for AI features and while we have a bunch of services to make it possible, there still is a learning curve. With this project, we aim to make integration of Azure AI services as effortless as **One Click**.

This project leverages Azure Functions, Cognitive Services and Azure ML Service under the hood to create AI accelerators for developers and partners to give them a working AI prototype to get started and then customize it further.

The scenarios are inspired by the asks that come our way from customers and partners and we work to create the artefacts that are instantly useable and customizable.

With help of ARM template, we also provide reference architectures utilizing industry best practices to minimize costs and provide scale as the core tenets of this project.
